# UFOD: A Unified Framework for Object Detection

UFOD is an open-source framework that enables the training and comparison of object detection models on 
custom datasets using different underlying frameworks and libraries. Currently, the most well-known object detection 
frameworks have been included in UFOD, and new tools can be easily incorporated thanks to UFOD's high-level API.
